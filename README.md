<br>Tool 1: Caesar Cipher Encryptor and Decryptor</br>
      <p>The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encrypting messages, named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to protect his military communications. This technique involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of places. For example, with a shift of three, the letter ‘A’ becomes ‘D’, ‘B’ becomes ‘E’, and so on. Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher formed the groundwork for modern cryptographic techniques. In this article, we’ll explore how the Caesar Cipher works, its significance, and its impact on the development of cryptography with its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<b>Advantages:</b>
<ol>Easy to implement and use thus, making suitable for beginners to learn about encryption.</ol>
<ol>Can be physically implemented, such as with a set of rotating disks or a set of cards, known as a scytale, which can be useful in certain situations.</ol>
<ol>Requires only a small set of pre-shared information.</ol>
<ol>Can be modified easily to create a more secure variant, such as by using a multiple shift values or keywords.</ol>
<b>Disadvantages:</b>
<ol>It is not secure against modern decryption methods.</ol>
<ol>Vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks, where an attacker has access to both the encrypted and unencrypted versions of the same messages.</ol>
<ol>The small number of possible keys means that an attacker can easily try all possible keys until the correct one is found, making it vulnerable to a brute force attack.</ol>
<ol>It is not suitable for long text encryption as it would be easy to crack.</ol>
<ol>It is not suitable for secure communication as it is easily broken.</ol>
<ol>Does not provide confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in a message.</ol> 

<b>Tool 2: Image Encryption and Decryption Tool</b>
<b>Encryption:</b>
        <p>It is nothing but a simple process in which we convert our data or information into secret code to prevent it from unauthorized access and keep it private and secure.</p>
<b>Decryption:</b>
        <p>It is nothing but a process of converting our encrypted data into a readable form. Here we will again apply the same XOR operation on an encrypted image to decrypt it. But always remember that our encryption key and decryption key must be the same.</p>


<b>Tool 3: Password Strength Checker</b>
<p>A password is said to be strong if it satisfies the following criteria: </p>

<ol>1.It contains at least one lowercase English character.</ol>
<ol>2.It contains at least one uppercase English character.</ol>
<ol>3.It contains at least one special character. The special characters are: !@#$%^&*()-+</ol>
<ol>4.Its length is at least 8.</ol>
<ol>5.It contains at least one digit.</ol>
<ol>6.Given a string, find its strength. Let a strong password is one that satisfies all above conditions. A moderate password is one that satisfies first three conditions and has length at least 6. Otherwise password is weak.</ol>

Examples : 
Input : “GeeksforGeeks!@12”
Output : Strong

Input : “gfg!@12”
Output : Moderate

<b>Tool 4: Kelogger Tool</b>
<p>Keystroke logging is the process of recording (logging) the keys pressed on a keyboard (usually when the user is unaware). It is also known as keylogging or keyboard capturing.
These programs are used for troubleshooting technical problems with computers and business networks. It can also be used to monitor network usages but more often than not it is used for malicious intents like stealing passwords.</p>


<b>Tool 5: Packet Sniffer and Network Analyzer</b>
<p>Packet sniffing means intercepting data packets as they pass through a network, just like looking inside envelopes in the mail. Experts use tools like Wireshark and tcpdump to track, troubleshoot, or secure networks. The packet analyzer Wireshark, or just Shark for short, functions as a magnifying glass; it captures and organizes the packets so you can gyrate over them looking for bugs in order to squash those wicked computer programs. tcpdump is even faster than sharks at grabbing data off of lines that run into walls. It doesn't have an interface but In general, packet sniffing tools offer close monitoring of network data flow and protect networks.</p>
